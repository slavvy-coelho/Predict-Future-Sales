# PREDICT FUTURE SALES
In this project, I dealt with data about shops, the corresponding items they hold and historical time series data about the transactions to predict future sales. We will go through various steps like cleaning the data, performing some analysis, useful clustering to finally make our way to predicting how the sales would look like in near future.

### Data
You are provided with daily historical sales data. The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations is part of the challenge.

File descriptions
sales_train.csv - the training set. Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.
test.csv - the test set. You need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
items.csv - supplemental information about the items/products.
item_categories.csv  - supplemental information about the items categories.
